## Overview

LinguaConnect is a scalable real-time communication platform that lets users find language exchange partners and practice through:

- **Text chat** with typing indicators, reactions, threads, and image uploads
- **Video calls** with screen sharing, recording, and live reactions
- A **friend system** and onboarding flow to personalize the experience
- **32 customizable UI themes** for a tailored interface

The app is built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and integrates **Stream's Chat & Video SDKs** to handle real-time messaging and video infrastructure at scale.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- A [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) account/cluster
- A [Stream](https://getstream.io/) account (for Chat & Video API keys)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory:

```env
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
STREAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend` directory:

```env
VITE_STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
```

>  Never commit your `.env` files. Make sure they're listed in `.gitignore`.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sameed995/linguaConnect.git
cd linguaConnect
```

Install dependencies for backend, frontend, and root:

```bash
npm install        # installs root-level dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
```

### Running Locally

**Start the backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

**Start the frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will typically run on `http://localhost:5173` and the backend on `http://localhost:5001` (or whichever ports you've configured).

---

## Deployment

LinguaConnect is configured for deployment on **[Render](https://render.com/)**, using a single web service that builds both the frontend and backend.

**Root `package.json` build script (example):**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start": "npm run start --prefix backend"
  }
}
```

**Render Configuration:**

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Build Command | `npm run build` |
| Start Command | `npm run start` |
| Environment | Node |

In production, the Express server serves the built frontend (`frontend/dist`) as static files, so the entire app runs from a single deployed service. Make sure all required environment variables (Mongo URI, JWT secret, Stream API keys) are set in your Render dashboard.

## Future Improvements

LinguaConnect is under active development. Planned enhancements include:

- **Email OTP Verification** — Verify user emails via a one-time password sent at signup, reducing fake accounts and improving trust.
- **Password Reset Workflow** — Allow users to securely reset forgotten passwords via an emailed reset link or OTP, with token expiry handling.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** — Optional extra login security layer for users.
- **Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection** — Throttle login/signup attempts to prevent abuse.
- **Profile Customization** — Profile pictures, bios, and language proficiency badges.
- **In-App Notifications (Real-Time)** — Push-style real-time notifications instead of polling.
- **Group Language Practice Rooms** — Multi-user video rooms focused on specific languages.
- **Automated Testing Suite** — Unit and integration tests for backend routes and React components (Jest/Vitest + Supertest).
- **CI/CD Pipeline** — GitHub Actions for automated linting, testing, and deployment on push.
- **Admin Dashboard** — Moderation tools for reported users/content.
